Hello and thank you for your interest in Brandon University Gaming Association (BUGA). 

We would like to officially welcome you to our club! We are a carefree gaming club based around console, pc, board, and role-playing games. BUGA started a couple years back, but has continued to grow and draw in more members. We wonâ€™t judge you, or tease you for loving games, anime or literary anything! Be as nerdy as you wish to be around us, and we will probably be just as nerdy back! Typically you can find most of our members in the Charlie Biggs down-under between our classes. We love to hang out and talk about everything from Monster Girls to Metal Gear Solid. If you think this is something you would like to join in, then come on down and chat with us!

Fun and games is basically our motto, but we do have a few educational aspects to our club. We have many veteran members who are computer inclined and very interested in teaching, assisting, and creating games. We also have in-house artists with the abilities to help you out with graphic design, drawing both traditionally and digitally, or your long sought after art commission. We have access to game development software such as RPG Maker and other resources. Our club members are usually willing to help out (if they can) whenever you might have problems with math, science, or basically anything. The great thing about BUGA is that we are multidisciplinary! Our members come from all disciplines across the campus.

We also hold meetings from time to time in order to discuss club purchases, future event planning, and much more. These meetings are not necessarily mandatory (Unless you're an executive or officer) but you are highly encouraged to attend and give your input. Meeting dates will be announced on our Facebook page.

We have made a large shift towards using Google Drive and most of our events will be displayed on our Google Drive Calendar, if you are interested in viewing this calendar please go to BUGA Gaming (Our in-progress website) or e-mail me back with the e-mail you typically use, and I will give you viewing rights to the calendar via Google Calendars. We also post a snapshot of the monthly calendar on our Facebook page.

BUGA has created a new system for its memberlist. A simple questionnaire online must be filled out in order for you rot be considered an 'official' member. We decided to implement this feature because it allows us to see what our members are interested in, and who is dedicated to actually being a member. The interesting thing about this questionnaire, is that it builds BUGA a memberlist by using Google sheets. This cuts the work for the executives as we can simply go to this sheet and see everyone quickly and easily. Please fill out this questionnaire by clicking the link and hitting submit at the bottom of the page when you are all done.
